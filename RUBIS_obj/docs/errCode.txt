 what's changed about output:
 almost nothing:
    -the name in the <title> tag on some pages.
    -on items you have bid on i chose to avoid item duplication
        (e.g. you have item currentprice yourmaxbid
                        1   1000         1000
                        1   1000         500            (deleted on this version)
    -on items sold from user there was a bug about current price, the row fetched was wrong and the field
     was automatically filled with "none". i just wrote none in every row directly.
    -fixed error on buynow nickname seller (they inserted the buyer nick)

NOTES:
    a bit of spaghetti code on Item class listing items, not much smart, i know.
    on this version you can use the InfoTableHeader of log Class instead of printHTMLHighlighted of PHPprinter
